Hospital: Patients's Analysis
1. Determine the average cost of treatment per customer. 
2. A gender-based study of the cost of length of stay. 
3. Use a map-based analysis to determine which states have the busiest hospitals. 
4. Wave over the mark on the Live Dashboard, which provides motion-based visuals,
and the whole dashboard will respond appropriately. This was done in order to make the visuals more engaging.
